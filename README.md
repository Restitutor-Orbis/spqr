# Calendar and Time
The calendar is based on the French Republican Calendar of the French Republic. The way I handle leap years is to simply add an extra day of celebration when it is a leap year in the Gregorian Calendar. Keeps it simple to convert. 

The clock is based on the French decimal time, where every day is divided into 10 hours of 100 minutes of 100 seconds. So the day has 100,000 (shorter) seconds compared to our normal 84,600.
